    # Domain 1: Risk of bias arising from the randomization process
    # 1.1 Was the allocation sequence random? Yes, computer-generated randomization.
    # 1.2 Was the allocation sequence concealed until participants were enrolled and assigned to interventions? Yes, using sealed opaque envelopes.
    # 1.3 Did baseline differences between intervention groups suggest a problem with the randomization process? No, baseline characteristics were similar.
    # 1.4 Risk-of-bias judgement: Low risk.

    # Example 2:
    # Research paper: Analysis of the impact of lifestyle changes on health outcomes.
    # Domain 2: Risk of bias due to deviations from the intended interventions
    # 2.1 Were participants aware of their assigned intervention during the trial? Yes.
    # 2.2 Were carers and people delivering the interventions aware of participants' assigned intervention during the trial? Yes.
    # 2.3 Were there deviations from the intended intervention that arose because of the trial context? Yes, some non-adherence occurred.
    # 2.4 Were these deviations likely to have affected the outcome? Possibly.
    # 2.5 Were these deviations from intended intervention balanced between groups? Yes.
    # 2.6 Was an appropriate analysis used to estimate the effect of assignment to intervention? Yes, intention-to-treat analysis.

    1.1 Was the allocation sequence random? 
        Yes, a random component was used such as computer-generated random numbers or coin tossing.
        No, the sequence is predictable or based on dates or patient record numbers.
        No information, only a statement that the study is randomized.
        Probably yes or Probably no can be used based on context and the trial's conduct.
        Y/PY/PN/N/NI
    1.2 Was the allocation sequence concealed until participants were enrolled and assigned to interventions?
        Yes, if remote or centrally administered methods were used, or envelopes/drug containers were handled properly.
        No, if there is reason to suspect the allocation was known.
        Y/PY/PN/N/NI
    1.3 Did baseline differences between intervention groups suggest a problem with the randomization process?
        No, if no imbalances are apparent or are compatible with chance.
        Yes, if imbalances suggest issues with randomization or if there are significant differences unlikely due to chance.
        No information, if baseline information is not available.
